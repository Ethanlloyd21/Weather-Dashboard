### User story

I want to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
so that I can plan a trip accordingly


### How does it work?

1. When the app is launched, a geolocation API locates the user's location and uses that coordinates to view the user's current location weather. 
2. The user then can view the current conditions and the 5 day forecast of his/her location.
3. The user can search multiple city location. Each city will display the current conditions and the 5 day forecast.
